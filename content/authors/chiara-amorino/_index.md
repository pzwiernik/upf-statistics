I am an Assistant Professor at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg, working on the STAMFORD project (ERC Consolidator Grant). I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics at Université Paris-Saclay under the supervision of Arnaud Gloter. My research focuses on statistical inference for stochastic processes, including Malliavin calculus, nonparametric estimation, and privacy-preserving methods.
