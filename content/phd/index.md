      title: PhD Opportunities
      text: |
        Our group welcomes students with a strong quantitative background who are interested in pursuing PhD studies in Statistics, Machine Learning, or Probability.
        
        The Statistics group at UPF is part of the Economics department and the university has no mathematics/statistics department. There are two main ways to pursue a PhD with us:

        1. **Via the PhD program in Economics at UPF**  
           Apply to the *Master of Research (MRes) year* (Year 2) of the [Economics PhD program](https://www.upf.edu/es/web/econ/phd) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. This second year is an equivalent of the 1st year of PhD Programs at North American institutions. Note that the department requires that students complete 5 years of university studies to be eligible to apply for this program. 
        
           Upon admission, students follow a tailored course plan—agreed upon with their advisors—and complete a Master’s thesis, which typically serves as the starting point for their PhD research; see [course listings](https://www.upf.edu/es/web/econ/courses).

        3. **Via a collaborating PhD program**  
           Students may also enroll in a PhD program at a collaborating institution—such as the [Statistics PhD program](https://www.eio.upc.edu/en/doctorate/doctoral-program-of-the-department-of-statistics-and-operations-research) or the [Applied Mathematics PhD program](https://appliedmathematics.postgrau.upc.edu/en) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. If arranged in advance it is possible to be supervised by a member of our group.  
        
           These programs typically do not require coursework, and students begin working on their dissertation from day one.

        ## Funding and Calendar
        All students in the PhD program in Economics at UPF are funded by the department. Student that work with as via a collaborating PhD program are typically financed by us.

        The application process is typically between November and January. Please contact us in advance so that we could guide you through this process.

        ## Examples
        [Richard Coll](https://richardcolljosifov.github.io/) is a student is a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, supervised by Gábor Lugosi (UPF) and Juanjo Rué (UPC).
        
        [Maxim Fedotov](https://www.upf.edu/en/web/econ/phd-e-i/-/asset_publisher/y8aJCiW7qGsx/content/fedotov-maxim/maximized) started as MSc student in our [Data Science program](https://bse.eu/masters-degrees/data-science/data-science-methodology). He is now doing the PhD Program at Universitat Pompeu Fabra supervised by Gábor Lugosi and David Rossell (both UPF).

        [Zhekai Pang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhekaipang/) completed MSc in Computational and Applied Economics at the University of Chicago. In 2025 he starts MRes year of the PhD program at UPF.
