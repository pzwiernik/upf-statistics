      title: PhD Opportunities
      text: |
        Our group welcomes students with a strong quantitative background who are interested in pursuing PhD studies in Statistics, Machine Learning, or Probability.
        
        The Statistics group at UPF is part of the Economics department and the university has no mathematics/statistics department. There are two main ways to pursue a PhD with us:

        1. **Via the PhD program in Economics at UPF**  
           Apply to the *Master of Research (MRes) year* (Year 2) of the [Economics PhD program](https://www.upf.edu/web/econ/phd-track) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.  
           Upon admission, students follow a tailored course plan—agreed upon with their advisors—and complete a Master’s thesis, which typically serves as the starting point for their PhD research.  
           DS students choose from a set of graduate-level courses, see [course listings](https://www.upf.edu/es/web/econ/courses).

        2. **Via a collaborating PhD program**  
           Students may also enroll in a PhD program at a collaborating institution—such as the [Statistics PhD program](https://www.eio.upc.edu/en/doctorate/doctoral-program-of-the-department-of-statistics-and-operations-research) or the [Applied Mathematics PhD program](https://appliedmathematics.postgrau.upc.edu/en) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya—while being supervised by a member of our group.  
           These programs typically do not require coursework, and students begin working on their dissertation from day one.
