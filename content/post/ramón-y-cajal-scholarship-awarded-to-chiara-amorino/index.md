Congratulations to Chiara for obtaining the Ramón y Cajal grant. The Ramón y Cajal 5-year tenure track contract (RyC) is funded by the [Spanish Ministry of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Science_(Spain)), that allows outstanding mid-career researchers in foreign countries to establish themselves in Spanish research institutions.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_y_Cajal_(scholarship)#cite_note-:0-1) It is the most prestigious nationally-funded research contract to follow a scientific career in Spain.
